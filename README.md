### General Info
Senior at the University of South Carolina studying computer science. ![Disclaimer, unfortunately these are not my hands. My hands have 4x as many implants as these as of now.](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71f2fda977db81e2894636fdbe141f33a2193134_2_674x500.jpg)



## Areas of Interest
Data analysis, Robotics, AI, and Open-Source software. Radio signal processing is also a major interest of mine, both stemming from and the reason for my  8 current [RFID/NFC implants.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-university-of-south-carolina-biohacker-embedded-his-college-id-in-his-hand)

Research is a strong focus of mine. As of now, I have 3 published papers, two of which were presented at conferences and one of which was published directly in a journal. These papers can be found in my [Academic Papers Repository](https://github.com/EvanBryer/Academic-Papers)

## Common Projects
[Data analysis tools](https://github.com/EvanBryer/PPM-Clustering-Improved) as well as occasionally projects stemming from mentoring First Robotics teams, including a [web-based PID simulator](https://github.com/EvanBryer/PID-Simulator). Some independent projects include [automated web routines](https://github.com/EvanBryer/Web-automate-test), [ray simulators](https://github.com/EvanBryer/RayTrace), and [Discord bots](https://github.com/EvanBryer/Discord-Hackweek)
