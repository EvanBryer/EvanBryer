### General Info
Student at the University of South Carolina studying computer science. ![Example of RFID Implants](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/71f2fda977db81e2894636fdbe141f33a2193134_2_674x500.jpg)


## Areas of Interest
Data analysis, Robotics, AI, and Open-Source software. Radio signal processing is also a major interest of mine, both stemming from and the reason for my 8 current RFID/NFC implants.

## Common Projects
Data analysis tools as well as occasionally projects stemming from mentoring First Robotics teams, including the web-based PID simulator, as well as some discord based projects such as the numerous bots.
